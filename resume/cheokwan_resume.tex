  \section{\sstyle Professional Experience}
  {\bf Lead Mobile Engineer -- Nbition Development Limited}, Hong Kong\hfill Nov 2013 -- Apr 2014
  \vspace{.05in}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item First employee. Single-handedly built the Garffee iOS app from scratch
        for demonstrating a ``Smart-Cafe'' idea which earned initial acclaims
        and fundings from the Hong Kong government and investors.
        The app allows user to pre-order on the go and feeds location tracking
        data to the order scheduling backend to eliminate waiting in line and
        ensure a smooth and fresh pickup at store.
  \item Handled every aspect of building a production level iOS client against a
        RESTful web service backend and Facebook API integration. Owned the MVC
        design and wrote in quick iterations everything from UI, animations,
        networking, data model and persistence, to unit-testing, and
        documentation.
  \item Prototyped a feature for fingerprinting high-frequency sound waves
        which serves as a unique solution to the indoor positioning problem.
        It involves digital signal processing techniques such as fast Fourier
        transform.
  \item Displayed a heart for quality by taking ownership and initiatives to
        deliver a user experience driven product with many subtle details and
        animations addressed.
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Senior Software Engineer -- Divide (Enterproid Inc.)}, Hong Kong\hfill Nov 2012 -- Nov 2013
  \vspace{.05in}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Core developer of the Divide iOS client - a secure and isolated BYOD
        container for any business data residing on personal devices. Work
        encompasses a wide scope of the Cocoa stack from UI to runtime
        functions hooking. Also contributed to components such as the Exchange
        mail sync engine, mail parser, and VPN. Pushing the limits of iOS
        enterprise functionality and improved the overall product quality.
  \item Developed a core FIPS-compliant Public Key Infrastructure library shared
        between Android and iOS using C/C++ and OpenSSL. It forms the basis of
        the S/MIME mail feature which I also implemented on the iOS side.
  \item Led and managed a team of 4 developers on both Android and iOS for the
        Divide Files feature - a file manager for storing mail attachments and
        cloud-storage files securely and sharing them between the container
        and enterprise patched apps. Contributed to the overall design and
        the majority of coding done on iOS.
  \item Improved the security and stability of the enterprise patched app
        feature on iOS.
        %By patching a custom dylib which performs all sorts of function hooking
        %it enables the secure container on many ordinary apps.
        Incorporated a secure and creative data sharing channel between the
        main container and patched apps by implementing a mini SSL like protocol
        over the pasteboard API.
  \item Bullet-proofed the jailbreak detection feature by adding a runtime code
        signing signature check for any loaded Mach-O dylib's.
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Software Engineer -- Silver Spring Networks}, Redwood City, CA USA\hfill Aug 2010 -- Jun 2012
  \vspace{.05in}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Took major responsibilities in developing Nodesim - a network device
        simulation product for virtualizing smart grid devices in scale,
        during which I took initiatives in the design, implementation,
        quality control, maintenance, and knowledge transfer of the product.
  \item Practiced network programming in C/C++ on Linux platforms with a
        multi-process, request-driven approach, during which I gained
        experience in:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item implementing dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 server/client applications.
        \item virtualizing the network stack and protocol of smart grid devices
              in pure software by modifying the low-level C code from device
              firmware and linking them against high-level application code.
        \item employing packet sniffing and spoofing using raw sockets and
              libpcap, making the simulated traffic transparent to other
              integrated back office software.
%        \item deriving solutions from device specifications and RFCs with
%              little explicit instructions.
        \end{itemize}
%  \item Built a light and robust mini name server in C/C++ for managing
%        multiple instances of the simulation tool hosting on the same server.
  \item Worked part-time in the middle tier and back end of a multi-tier Java EE
        web application which employs Spring, Tomcat, and Oracle. Incorporated
        a feature for automatic schema migration between version upgrades.
  \item Invented a UDP traffic forwarder in Python using raw sockets for
        multicasting packets as is to various destinations.
  \end{itemize}

  \section{\sstyle Highlights of Coursework and Projects}
  {\sl Programming Languages and Compilers}
%  \vspace{.05in}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed a dynamically typed interpreted language with extensions such
        as coroutine and list comprehension; all based on a lexer, Earley parser
        generator, and bytecode interpreter built from scratch.
%  \item Implemented a simple HTML rendering engine by writing code in the
%        language above to traverse the DOM generated from HTML by the parser
%        generator.
  \end{itemize}

%  {\sl Operating Systems and System Programming}
%  \vspace{.05in}
